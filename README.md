## Hello, and thank you for visiting.

I'm currently reading Information Technology at university, and also studying web development independently, at my own pace.
At the moment, I'm focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, primarily using freeCodeCamp as a resource.

I'm also working on improving my English, as my native language is Japanese.

Though I'm still building confidence, I'm enjoying the learning journey and gradually progressing.
This GitHub serves as a record of my ongoing development.

Thank you once again for stopping by.
